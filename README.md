I had some issues while completing this assignment. I accidentally committed some changes to the content-test branch instead of the main branch so I had to research how to remove commits and move changes back from the staging area as well. Also, when I tried to push my commits to the remote repository, I received a authentication error message so I had to research how to use personal access tokens.
